# Foreword

This is one of the first ever program that I wrote in 2002 implemented in QBasic as I was learning to program. It tries its best to imitate `who wants to be a millionare` TV game show.

There are aspects of it which I now think are hilarious which is why I am sharing it so do give it a go.

You will probably need a DOS emulator like [Boxer] to get it working on OSX. I have not had a chance to deploy it on the latest versions of Windows and Linux so do let me know how you get on if you do.
